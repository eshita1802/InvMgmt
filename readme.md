# Inventory Management System - NVCTI
We developed an inventory management system prototype for NVCTI (tinkering and innovation cell of IIT (ISM) Dhanbad). NVCTI has several labs such as robotic technology, smart manufacturing, electronic mobility, etc. This system was designed to manage and track the equipment these labs use. It keeps a record of the date of purchase of inventory, supplier, quantity, etc. It is also used to keep a record of the details of the students who have lent a piece of particular lab equipment to work on their projects as well as their designated due dates. 
It includes authentication/authorization of the user, and then the user is directed to the home page where they can view the inventory purchased/ lent to students. Then can perform CRUD operations on the inventory and export the data as a CSV file. We have used MERN stack in this project.
